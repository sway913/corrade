# Wait for emulator to start (done in parallel to build) and run tests

# `adb push` uploads timeout quite often, and then CircleCI waits 10 minutes
# until it aborts the job due to no output. CTest can do timeouts on its own,
# but somehow the default is 10M seconds, which is quite a lot honestly.
# Instead set the timeout to 15 seconds which should be enough even for very
# heavy future benchmarks, and try two more times if it gets stuck.
